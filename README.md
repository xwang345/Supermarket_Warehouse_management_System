Warehouse management systems are now a key part of the retail supply chain and provide directed stock rotation, intelligent picking directives, automatic consolidation and cross-docking to maximize a retailer's resources.

Most retailers will benefit from using the capabilities of a modern WMS to improve warehouse efficiencies. For example, "creating pick waves is one WMS function that can be used to group pick tickets together by some predetermined criteria (e.g., by shipping zone or region)" Wagner says. "Cross-docking" the movement of goods directly from the receiving dock to the shipping dock is another way to improve warehouse efficiency." Advanced systems also can help retailers manage shelf sensitive product by instructing the warehouse staff to move the oldest product first.
